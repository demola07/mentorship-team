# Node.js Mentorship Program

As a developer, I fell in love with the NodeJS runtime development platform when I first discovered and started working with it, because it afforded me the opportunity to write server-side code with JavaScript, I struggled to understand its working and operations at first, because I had little guidance. I had to figure out a lot of things on my own with little or no help. I would like to join the mentorship team because this will afford me the opportunity to learn more and get a deeper understanding about the NodeJS ecosystem and also connect me with seasoned Node.js developers and community members. In the famous words of Ryan Dahl “You can never understand everything, but you should push yourself to understand the internals”, I would like to understand the internal working of the NodeJS ecosystem, and joining the mentorship team will be a step towards the right direction for me. I also hope to contribute to the ecosystem, I have always been passionate about open source contributions and this is one opportunity I will cherish and take good advantage of. Finally, joining the team will also afford me the opportunity of helping others struggling with their understanding of NodeJS, as I will be able to provide them with the relevant knowledge and guidance in their respective endeavors.
